Creating classes

Task 0
Writing an empty class 'Square' that defines a square

Task 1
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 0-square.py

Task 2
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 1-square.py)

Task 3
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 2-square.py)

Task 4
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 3-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area

Task 5
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 4-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Instantiation with optional size: def __init__(self, size=0):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line

Task 6
Write a class Square that defines a square by: (based on 5-square.py)

Private instance attribute: size:
property def size(self): to retrieve it
property setter def size(self, value): to set it:
size must be an integer, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message size must be an integer
if size is less than 0, raise a ValueError exception with the message size must be >= 0
Private instance attribute: position:
property def position(self): to retrieve it
property setter def position(self, value): to set it:
position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers, otherwise raise a TypeError exception with the message position must be a tuple of 2 positive integers
Instantiation with optional size and optional position: def __init__(self, size=0, position=(0, 0)):
Public instance method: def area(self): that returns the current square area
Public instance method: def my_print(self): that prints in stdout the square with the character #:
if size is equal to 0, print an empty line
position should be use by using space
